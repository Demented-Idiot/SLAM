SLAM
=======

At the moment the initial setup does not import the database structure for you.

You should do this manually by importing the .sql file first.
Once this is done put everything else into a folder visible in a browser and navigate to the root - You should now be greeted with an SQL setup screen.


Initial usernames and passwords are:

Administrator / password
Test / test

(Really Secure!!!!)
